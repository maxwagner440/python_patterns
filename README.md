## Decorator
  Adding features to existing object dynamically without using subclassing
  
  
## Proxy
  Postponing object creation due to resource intensive nature of object by creating placeholder
  - clients interact with proxy.
  - proxy makes object

## Adapter
  Solving problem of two clients that do not understand each other. 
  - clients speak different "languages" and need to be adapted to each other.

## Composite
  Composite - Maintains a tree-data structure to represent part-whole relationships
    - Recursive tree data structure
    - menu, sub-menu items with sub-menu items
## Bridge 
  - helps to untangle complex class heirarchy
  - two abstractions with implementation dependent and independent


## Observer

 - Subjects need to be monitored
 - Observers need to be notified when change in subject

## Visitor
 - Adds new features to existing classes without changing classes

## Iterator
 - Allows client to have access to elements of an aggregate objects without exposing underlying structure

## Strategy
 - Offers number of dynaically interchangable clients to object?

## Chain of Responsibility
 - Decouples requests and their processing
